## Why PDKPASS

PDKPASS turns AI Passport into a compact, offline-first F1 companion. Open it
to see the current or next Grand Prix, browse the season, check the driver
standings, inspect circuit details, and revisit the top three from every
supported weekend session.

- Selects the current or next round automatically using Beijing time.
- Gives every round its own colour while keeping the race-pass visual language
  consistent across the calendar, details, standings, results, setup, and
  season-end screens.
- Bundles the complete 2026 calendar and distinct circuit outlines for offline
  first use.
- Downloads the current season and standings when online, then keeps the latest
  valid copy available offline.
- Caches podiums for FP1, FP2, FP3, sprint qualifying, sprint, qualifying, and
  the Grand Prix as results become available.
- Dims and turns off the backlight after inactivity.

## No app required

No phone app is required. When no working network has been saved, PDKPASS shows
a temporary Wi-Fi name, password, and `192.168.4.1` on its home screen:

1. Connect a phone to the displayed `PDKPASS-XXXX` Wi-Fi network.
2. Open `http://192.168.4.1` in the phone browser.
3. Enter a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi name and password, then press **Connect**.

PDKPASS tests the connection before saving it. A wrong password leaves the setup
page available for another attempt. After five failed attempts to reconnect to a
previously saved network, setup becomes available again automatically.

The top status changes through `SETUP`, `WIFI...`, `TIME...`, and `ONLINE`.
After time synchronization, the device keeps counting locally. It rechecks the
season at Beijing midnight and at the current round's switch boundary, as well
as after the network becomes available. Each online round remains current until
its recorded race end, then the dashboard advances to the following round. The
bundled offline fallback uses a four-hour window from the scheduled race start.
After the final round it displays `SEASON COMPLETE`.

## Session results

When a session has ended, open its race details and press **OK** to browse FP1,
FP2, FP3, sprint qualifying, sprint, qualifying, and race results. PDKPASS waits
at least 30 minutes after the recorded session end, then checks for the top
three. The background worker retries at a low rate, so a free result normally
appears about 30–40 minutes after the session and remains available offline once
cached. A normal weekend reports `NO SESSION` for sprint-only slots.

Historical session classifications and driver metadata come from the unofficial
[OpenF1 API](https://openf1.org/docs/). PDKPASS uses the unauthenticated
historical endpoint and does not embed an OpenF1 account, password, or access
token.

## Season data and offline behaviour

The first-use fallback is an offline snapshot captured on 31 August 2026 from the
[official 2026 Formula 1 calendar](https://www.formula1.com/en/racing/2026) and
[official driver standings](https://www.formula1.com/en/results/2026/drivers).
Displayed session times are converted to China Standard Time (UTC+8).

After the first successful connection, PDKPASS downloads and stores the Grand
Prix calendar for the current Beijing-time year and the standings from the
latest completed race. At a year boundary it switches only after OpenF1 returns
at least one valid Grand Prix for the new year; otherwise it keeps the last
working season and tries again at the next scheduled check. The device stores
one current season at a time, including up to 24 races, 24 drivers, and the
cached podiums for all seven supported session types. The previous season cache
is replaced only after the new season has been accepted.

The most recent valid time, accepted season, standings, and downloaded podiums
remain available offline. After a long powered-off period, reconnect to refresh
them. Dynamic calendar, standings, session classifications, and driver metadata
come from the unofficial [OpenF1 API](https://openf1.org/docs/).

### Circuit-outline provenance

The compact 2026 outlines were resampled to 48 segments from the creator's
local Apex track resource set. Its metadata references OpenF1's
`circuit_info_url` and MultiViewer for most circuits, OpenStreetMap geometry for
Sepang, and the official Madring circuit map for Madring. PDKPASS embeds only
the resampled coordinates, not the source JSON, SVG, or map artwork.

OpenF1 identifies the detailed circuit information as data provided by
[MultiViewer](https://multiviewer.app/docs/); Sepang's geometry is attributed to
[OpenStreetMap contributors](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright). This is
an independent, non-commercial fan use. Review the relevant source terms before
any commercial redistribution.

## Try the real interface on macOS

The repository includes a native simulator that runs the same PDKPASS screens,
navigation, themes, circuit outlines, standings, and result layouts as the
firmware.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeopardDennis/ai-passport-pdkpass.git
cd ai-passport-pdkpass
./tools/pdkpass-simulator/run.sh
```

Use `--race 1` through `--race 23` to open another round. See the
[simulator guide](tools/pdkpass-simulator/README.md) for keyboard controls,
headless screenshots, and historical-result sync.

## Build the firmware

Use ESP-IDF 5.5.3 and run:

```bash
./tools/validate.sh --static
./tools/validate.sh --firmware
```

Only distribute the validated `build/FoloToy-AI-Passport-full.bin` artifact.
The complete build, flashing cautions, and protected Recovery requirements are
documented in the [build and test guide](docs/development/build-and-test.md).
