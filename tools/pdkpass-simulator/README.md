# PDKPASS macOS simulator

This native Mac simulator runs the production PDKPASS LVGL screens, navigation
state machine, circuit outlines, themes, calendar, standings, and result layout.
It scales the device's exact 240 × 320 RGB565 framebuffer with nearest-neighbour
rendering instead of recreating the interface as a web mockup.

The simulator uses an offline 2026 season calendar and standings snapshot. When
a historical results page is opened while the simulator is online, it retrieves
that round's real session classifications from OpenF1 and caches completed
podiums in the user's macOS cache directory. Network number keys exercise the
firmware's connection states; only the online state permits result sync.

## Requirements

- macOS
- Xcode Command Line Tools
- CMake 3.16 or later
- the repository's generated `managed_components/` directory
- an internet connection when loading uncached historical results

If `managed_components/` is absent, run one normal ESP-IDF configure or build
first so the locked LVGL dependency is available.

## Build and run

From the repository root:

```bash
./tools/pdkpass-simulator/run.sh
```

If the executable bit was not preserved when the repository was copied, use
`bash tools/pdkpass-simulator/run.sh`. The equivalent manual commands are:

```bash
cmake -S tools/pdkpass-simulator -B build/pdkpass-simulator
cmake --build build/pdkpass-simulator -j
./build/pdkpass-simulator/pdkpass-simulator
```

The default home screen previews round 13. Use another round as the automatic
home selection with, for example:

```bash
./tools/pdkpass-simulator/run.sh --race 1
```

## Controls

| Mac input | Device action |
| --- | --- |
| Up / Down | Browse |
| Return or Space | OK |
| Hold Return for 0.65 seconds | Back |
| Escape | Back |
| `1` / `2` / `3` / `4` / `5` | Setup / connecting / time sync / online / offline |
| `S` or Command-S | Save the current 240 × 320 screen as PNG |

For a headless render suitable for a smoke test:

```bash
./build/pdkpass-simulator/pdkpass-simulator \
  --race 13 --screenshot /tmp/pdkpass-simulator.png
```

To verify and capture a real historical FP1 classification without opening a
window:

```bash
./build/pdkpass-simulator/pdkpass-simulator --race 1 --sync-results \
  --screenshot /tmp/pdkpass-australia-fp1.png
```
